To access the Jizo M service, you need to:
- Be registred as operator (user role) by Security Adminstrator.
- Get user credentials (Username, Password) as parameters for the integration.

The operator connects to the JizôM Web via HTTPS. The self-signed certificates are used.
The operator can connect to the JizoM via a browser then enter the URL :"https://ip_adress:port/" 
with:
    • port: operator connection port is 9001
    • ip_adress : IP address for management interface (im).
If the operator wants to access to swagger api documentation, a suffix must be added to the API URL: "https://ip_adress:port/api/doc"

When the JizôM operator account is created by JizôM Web security administrator, the operator must connect to the JizôM Web at least a first time.
At the first connection, the following page « Please change your Password » is displayed to ask an user to change password.
